### Description

### Maintenance cost vs benefit

<!--
As the project maintainer, I have to carefully balance new features with the limited time available for maintenance.
While we highly value contributions, new features grow the codebase and increase the ongoing maintenance burden - so
consider user-benefit vs maintenance cost. See https://github.com/scanamo/scanamo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#new-features
for more details.
-->

* **Benefit**: <!-- eg, adds the capability to do X, better (in what ways?) than directly using the AWS SDK -->
* **Cost**: <!-- eg, adds this much extra implementation code, modifies this many files, breaks compatibility, etc -->

### Tests

<!--
Any new functionality should have at least one test, both to check correctness, and demonstrate API use.
-->

<!-- GitHub Issues, PRs (including Scanamo PRs that have previously touched this area), AWS documentation, etc -->
