Scanamo is a library to make using [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dynamodb/) with Scala 
simpler and less error-prone.

The main focus is on making it easier to avoid mistakes and typos by leveraging Scala's type system and some
higher level abstractions.

Installation
------------

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scanamo" %% "scanamo" % "1.0.0-M23"
```

Scanamo is published for Scala 2.13 and Scala 2.12.

Basic Usage
-----------

Note: the `LocalDynamoDB` object is provided by the `scanamo-testkit` package.

```scala
scala> import org.scanamo._
scala> import org.scanamo.syntax._
scala> import org.scanamo.generic.auto._
 
scala> val client = LocalDynamoDB.client()
scala> import software.amazon.awssdk.services.dynamodb.model.ScalarAttributeType._
scala> val farmersTableResult = LocalDynamoDB.createTable(client)("farmer")("name" -> S)

scala> case class Farm(animals: List[String])
scala> case class Farmer(name: String, age: Long, farm: Farm)
scala> val table = Table[Farmer]("farmer")

scala> val ops = for {
     |   _ <- table.putAll(Set(
     |       Farmer("McDonald", 156L, Farm(List("sheep", "cow"))),
     |       Farmer("Boggis", 43L, Farm(List("chicken")))
     |     ))
     |   mcdonald <- table.get("name" -> "McDonald")
     | } yield mcdonald
scala> Scanamo.exec(client)(ops)
res1: Option[Either[error.DynamoReadError, Farmer]] = Some(Right(Farmer(McDonald,156,Farm(List(sheep, cow)))))
```
